			<h4>Bioinformatics Analyst Intern</h4>

				I worked as a Bioinformatics analyst intern in the Bioinformatics research team at CGI. I developed a database that stores the variant information of the cancer samples. We used the cbioportal codebase and made changes to store the CGI specific data. We also used the cbioportal web application code for data visualization and analysis. I was also involved in the development of the automated NGS pipeline for the analysis of the raw NGS sequencing data. We improved the CGI NGS pipeline by adding picard, freebayes, snpSift and snpEff tools for variant calling.
