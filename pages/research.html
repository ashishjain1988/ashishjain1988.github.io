			<h4>Characterization of the BMP4 treated human embryonic stem cells (hESCs)</h4>
			<p>
				Many questions have been raised on the true identity of the bone morphogenetic protein-4 (BMP4), activin-A signaling inhibitor, and FGF2 signaling inhibitor treated human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Studies showing the trophoblast lineage of the differentiated hESCs cells (ESCd) are based only on a few marker genes and physical properties. Due to this, some research groups raised doubts over the findings and speculated that hESCs differentiates into mesoderm lineage. Therefore, we carried out a genome-wide comparison of the ESCd with mesoderm and various placental cell lines to identify the true origins of these cells. Our results show that hESCs differentiates into placental cells and also have high expression of genes related to invasion and differentiation, even more than the other placental cell lines. Using the co-expression network analysis, we identified gene modules involved in cell migration and adhesion which are important for early placental development. The study also revealed novel genes which potentially play an important role in early stages of pregnancy. This is the first study to systematically carry out a genome wide comparison of ESCd with other placental cell lines, providing an insight into the transcriptional regulation during early placenta development.

			<h4>Placenta-SeqDB: Curation and annotation of publicly available placenta sequencing dataset</h4>
			<p>
				During the last few years, placental development research has started gaining a lot of attention from the research community. Improvement in NGS techniques has led to an increase in the number of sequencing samples submitted to public databases. GEO is one of the largest data repositories used for storing publically available experimental datasets. However, there are no strict guidelines for submitting the metadata information related to the datasets. There are many discrepancies in the metadata annotation including cell/tissue type, experiment type, and gestational age which make it very difficult to search for specific datasets. Arrayexpress is another such data repository which has a good search engine but it lacks well-annotated placenta-specific terms and features. Because of these issues, searching and retrieving data from these databases poses a great challenge for public data reuse. There are few other databases which have good annotations but donâ€™t have placental datasets. To address this problem, we built a data repository by combining manually curated sequencing datasets including RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, and DNAse-Seq from different data repositories including GEO, Arrayexpress, ENA, and CistromeMap. The datasets are linked to the dataset specific genes and diseases through manual curation from research papers. We also developed a new controlled vocabulary based on the curated sample metadata including cell/tissue type, sequencing platform, associated genes, disease, and developmental time points. This resource will help the researchers to search placenta datasets in a quick and efficient manner.

			<h4>SPINNER</h4>
			<p>
				SPINNER stands for Seeded Protein Interaction Network Neighborhood Expansion and Ranking Algorithm tool. This is an automated tool, which expands the initial seed proteins related to a particular disease, by using the network neighborhood expansion and create protein interaction network for protein network analysis. It expands the protein network by using the Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) data from the databases like STRING and HAPPI. It also uses a heuristic scoring function for calculating the initial rank score and modified page rank algorithm for calculating the iterative rank score of the proteins in the protein network. This tool also calculates the effect on the network, after the removal of protein from the sub-network. This is called as protein perturbation. As we know, there are certain hub nodes in the protein networks, which play a key role in the activation of the disease. This feature will help us to identify those key hubs which would help in identifying potential drug targets. Using this tool I carried out the analysis of the Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Breast Cancer.

			<h4>GEMINE (Gene Expression Mutation Interaction Neighborhood Exploration)</h4>
			<p>
				Developed the database which stores the data regarding the significance of genes in cancers based on their gene expression and mutations. The raw data has been taken from COSMIC and TCGA and the differentially expressed genes have been filtered and prioritized on the basis of their SPINNER rank. We also calculate the similarity between the genes on the basis of the gene expression data from TCGA and mutation data from COSMIC. We also developed the web application, which is used to browse through the database using PHP and javascript.

			<h4>Smart Health</h4>
			<p>
				Smart Health is an Electronic Medical Record (EMR) Project which was developed in collaboration with Wenzhou Medical Centre, China. The project involves efficient storage of health examination data that has been provided by Wenzhou Medical Centre. We designed and developed the data model and stored the health examination data in an Oracle database. In this process, we developed automated tools to carry out preprocessing and normalization of the data. We also developed a scoring scheme for scoring individuals on the basis of their test results. The scoring scheme can be used to develop prediction models which can be used to predict the potential disease threat on the basis of the current health conditions of an individual.
